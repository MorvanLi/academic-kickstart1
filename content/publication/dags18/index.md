abstract: Spiking neural P systems (in short, SNP systems) are a class of distributed parallel computing devices, abstracted from the way neurons communicate by means of spikes. This paper discusses spiking neural P systems with structural plasticity and anti-spikes (in short, SNP-SPA systems), a new variant of SNP systems with two interesting features: structural plasticity and anti-spike. By means of plasticity rules in neurons, SNP-SPA systems can provide a dynamic directed graph structure. Turing universality of SNP-SPA systems is discussed. It is proven that SNP-SPA systems as number generating/accepting devices are Turing universal, and a small example with 56 neurons that computes a universal function is constructed. The introduction of anti-spikes allows to reduce the modules in the proof of universality.
