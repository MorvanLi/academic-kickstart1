abstract: In this paper we revisit some of the main aspects of the DAGS Key Encapsulation Mechanism, one of the code-based candidates to NISTâ€™s standardization call for the key exchange/encryption functionalities. In particular, we modify the algorithms for key generation, encapsulation and decapsulation to fit an alternative KEM framework, and we present a new set of parameters that use binary codes. We discuss advantages and disadvantages for each of the variants proposed.
